# Cloud Native GeoServer Gateway service


**Docker image**: `cloudnativegeoserver/gs-cloud-gateway`. 

**Service name**: `gateway-service`. 

This is the logical service name by which web clients will get the actual instances addresses from the [discovery-service](discovery-service.yml) and perform client-side load balancing against when interacting with the service.
