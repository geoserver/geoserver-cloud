# GeoServer Cloud

*GeoServer Cloud* is  [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) ready to use in the cloud through dockerized microservices.

This project is an opinionated effort to split *GeoServer*'s geospatial services and API offerings as individually deployable components of a [microservices based architecture](https://microservices.io/).

As such, it builds on top of existing *GeoServer* software components, adapting and/or extending them in an attempt to achieve functional decomposition by business capability; which roughly means each OWS service, the Web UI, the REST API, and probably other components such as the *Catalog and Configuration subsystem*, become self-contained, individually deployable and scalable micro-services.

## Quick start

You can easily deploy and test locally GeoServer Cloud after cloning this repository on your computer by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-shared_datadir.yml up -d
```

This will start a GeoServer Cloud stack using a file based backend as catalog system.

Browse to [http://localhost:9090/geoserver/cloud](http://localhost:9090/geoserver/cloud) to access the GeoServer UI.


## Architecture

The following diagram depicts the system's general architecture.

*GeoServer Cloud Architecture Diagram*

Does that mean *GeoServer*'s `.war` is deployed several times, with each instance exposing a given "business capability"?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
Each microservice is its own self-contained application, including only the GeoServer dependencies it needs. Moreover, care has been taken so that when a dependency has both required and non-required components, only the required ones are loaded.

## Technology

With *GeoServer* being a traditional, [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) based, monolithic servlet application, a logical choice has been made to base the *GeoServer* derived microservices in the [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework.

Additionally, [Spring Cloud](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) technologies enable crucial capabilities such as [dynamic service discovery](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-netflix), [externalized configuration](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-config), [distributed events](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-bus), [API gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway), and more.

Only a curated list of the [vast amount](http://geoserver.org/release/stable/) of GeoServer extensions will be supported, as they are verified and possibly adapted to work with this project's architecture. The current version supports the following extensions:
- jdbc config
- jdbc store
- pgraster
- datadir-catalog-loader
- authkey authentication
- web-resource explorer
- css style
- mb style
- GWC S3 Storage
- GWC Azure Blob Storage
- Pregeneralized feature datastore
- vectortiles
- flatgeobuf
- cog
- importer

Advanced ACL system is available through the project [GeoServer ACL](https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver-acl) which offers the same capacities as GeoFence.

OAuth is available by using the geOrchestra Gateway in replacement of the GeoServer Cloud one.

## License

*GeoServer Cloud* licensed under the [GPLv2](LICENSE.txt).

## Building

Requirements:

 * Java >= 17 JDK
 * [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) >= `3.6.3`
 * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) version >= `19.03.3`
 * [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) version >= `1.26.2`

The simple `make` command from the project root directory will build and install all the required components, including upstream GeoServer dependencies and GeoServer-Cloud Docker images. So for a full build just run:

```bash
make
```

Then for further builds, unless the `geoserver_submodule/` has changed, you can build without running tests with

```bash
make install
```

and run tests with

```bash
make test
```

### Custom upstream GeoServer version

*GeoServer Cloud* depends on a custom GeoServer branch, `gscloud/gs_version/integration`, which contains patches to upstream GeoServer that have not yet been integrated into the mainstream `main` branch.

Additionally, this branch changes the artifact versions from `2.23-SNAPSHOT` to `2.23.0-CLOUD`, to avoid confusing maven if you also work with vanilla GeoServer, and to avoid your IDE downloading the latest `2.23-SNAPSHOT` artifacts from the OsGeo maven repository, overriding your local maven repository ones, and having confusing compilation errors that would require re-building the branch we need.

The `gscloud/gs_version/integration` branch is checked out as a submodule under the `geoserver_submodule/geoserver` directory.

The root `pom.xml` defines a `geoserver` maven profile, active by default, that includes the module `geoserver_submodule`, which in turn includes all the required `geoserver` modules for this project.

So in general, you may choose to only eventually build the `geoserver_submodule` subproject, since it won't change
frequently, with

```bash
make deps
```

### Build the docker images

As mentioned above, a `make` with no arguments will build everything.

But to build only the docker images, run:

```bash
make build-image
```

### Targeted builds

*GeoServer Cloud*-specific modules source code is under the `src/` directory.

When you already have the `2.23.0-CLOUD` GeoServer artifacts, you can choose to only build these projects, either by:


```bash
$ ./mvnw clean install -f src/
```

Or 

```bash
$ cd src/
$ ../mvnw clean install
```

### Development runs

To run the development docker composition using a shared data directory.

GeoServer-Cloud can start from an empty directory.

Edit your ```.env``` file to set the ```GS_USER``` variable to your user id and group,
then do:

```bash
$ mkdir docker-compose_datadir
$ alias dcd="docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-shared_datadir.yml"
$ dcd up -d
```
Note: In case you want to start the docker composition and be able to test some layers, you can copy data/release datadir that is part of the geoserver_submodule instead of creating the docker-compose_datadir emtpy folder, as follows:

```bash
$ cp -rf ./geoserver_submodule/geoserver/data/release /tmp/datadir
$ ln -s /tmp/datadir docker-compose_datadir
```

Verify the services are running with `dcd ps`.

Healthchecks use `curl` hitting the `http:localhost:8081/actuator/health`.

The services run on the `8080` port, and are exposed using different host ports. The spring-boot-actuator is set up at port `8081`.

The `gateway-service` proxies requests from the `9090` local port:

```
$ curl "http://localhost:9090/geoserver/cloud/ows?request=getcapabilities&service={WMS,WFS,WCS}"
$ curl -u admin:geoserver "http://localhost:9090/geoserver/cloud/rest/workspaces.json"
```

Browse to [http://localhost:9090/geoserver/cloud/](http://localhost:9090/geoserver/cloud/)

> Note the `/geoserver/cloud` context path is set up in the `gateway-service`'s externalized
> configuration, and enforced through the `GEOSERVER_BASE_PATH` in `docker-compose.yml`.
> You can change it to whatever you want. The default [config/gateway-service.yml](config/gateway-service.yml)
> configuration file does not set up a context path at all, and hence GeoServer will
> be available at the root URL.

To test GeoServer Cloud with different catalog backends, change the alias to replace the `docker-compose-shared_datadir.yml` file by one of the following:
- Use `docker-compose-jdbcconfig.yml` for a JDBC based catalog backend (uses jdbc config and jdbc store modules)
- Use `docker-compose-pgconfig.yml` for a JNDI based catalog backend

You can also run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-discovery-ha.yml` to run extra discovery service instances for HA.

## Deployment

Docker images for all the services are available on DockerHub, under the GeoServer Cloud organization (https://hub.docker.com/u/geoservercloud/).

You can find  production-suitable deployment files for docker-compose and podman under the [docs/deploy](docs/deploy) folder.

Also, a ready-to-use Helm chart for Kubernetes is available at the [camptocamp/helm-geoserver-cloud](https://github.com/camptocamp/helm-geoserver-cloud) Github repository.
