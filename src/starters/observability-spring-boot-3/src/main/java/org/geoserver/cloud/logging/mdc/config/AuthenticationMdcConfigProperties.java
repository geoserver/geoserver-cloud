/**
 * Configuration properties for controlling which authentication information is included in the MDC.
 * <p>
 * These properties determine what user-related information is added to the MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)
 * during request processing. Including this information in the MDC makes it available to all logging
 * statements, providing valuable context for audit, security, and debugging purposes.
 * <p>
 * The properties are configured using the prefix {@code logging.mdc.include.user} in the application
 * properties or YAML files.
 * <p>
 * Example configuration in YAML:
 * <pre>
 * logging:
 *   mdc:
 *     include:
 *       user:
 *         id: true
 *         roles: true
